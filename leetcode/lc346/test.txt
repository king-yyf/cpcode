Some edges have a weight of -1 (wi = -1), while others have a positive weight (wi > 0). task is to modify all edges with a weight of -1 by assigning them positive values so that the shortest distance between the nodes source and destination becomes equal to target. If there are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between source and destination equal to target, any of them will be considered correct.

Return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if it is possible to make the shortest distance from source to destination equal to target, or an empty array if it's impossible.

Note: You are not allowed to modify the weights of edges with initial positive weights.

Edge Weight Assignment so that the shortest distance between node source and destination is target


set all edges with weight -1 to positive integer, so that the shortest distance between nodes s and t equal to an target. If there are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between source and destination equal to target, output any of them.
