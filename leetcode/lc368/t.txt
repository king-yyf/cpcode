Minimum Changes to Make K Semi-palindromes Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that the sum of the number of letter changes required to turn each substring into a semi-palindrome is minimized.

output the minimum number of letter changes required.

A string with a length of len is considered a semi-palindrome if there exists a positive integer d such that 1 <= d < len and len % d == 0, and if we take indices that have the same modulo by d, they form a palindrome.
