Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones You are given a 0-indexed binary array nums of length n, a positive integer k and a non-negative integer maxChanges.
Select any index j != dylanIndex such that nums[j] == 0 and set nums[j] = 1. This action can be performed at most maxChanges times.
Select any two adjacent indices x and y (|x - y| == 1) such that nums[x] == 1, nums[y] == 0, then swap their values (set nums[y] = 1 and nums[x] = 0). If y == dylanIndex, Dylan picks up the one after this move and nums[y] becomes 0.
