Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable
[[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]] [1,1,0,2]

可以到达每一个节点的最少边反转次数
对于范围 [0, n - 1] 中的每一个节点 i ，你的任务是分别 独立 计算 最少 需要多少次 边反转 ，从节点 i 出发经过 一系列有向边 ，可以到达所有的节点。

given a tree very node i independently calculate the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node i through a sequence of directed edges.



Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable 显示英文描述 
There is a simple directed graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph would form a tree if its edges were bi-directional.
You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] represents a directed edge going from node ui to node vi.
An edge reversal changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node ui to node vi becomes a directed edge going from node vi to node ui.
