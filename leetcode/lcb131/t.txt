For a query of type 1, queries[i] = [1, x]. Build an obstacle at distance x from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is no obstacle at distance x when the query is asked.
For a query of type 2, queries[i] = [2, x, sz]. Check if it is possible to place a block of size sz anywhere in the range [0, x] on the line, such that the block entirely lies in the range [0, x]. A block cannot be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do not actually place the block. Queries are separate.
